## Challenges Faced by Students During Placement Season:

The objective of this report is to analyse the challenges faced by students during the placement season, identify the key issues hindering their success, and recommend solutions to address these problems. The report aims to provide insights into the placement process, the information gaps students experience, and the resources they need to navigate the placement season effectively.

### Problems Faced by Students: 

•Eligibility Criteria (CGPA and Branch): Students face challenges meeting the minimum CGPA requirement and branch-specific restrictions, which limit their job opportunities. Some companies have eligibility based on CGPA or hire only specific branches like CS/IT.

•	Number of Companies: The number of companies coming for placements can be overwhelming for students, making it difficult to prioritize and select the right opportunities.

•	Mass Hiring Companies: Some companies focus on mass hiring, which may not align with the student's specific skills or career goals.
•	Branch-Specific Hiring: Many companies come for placements but hire only from specific branches like CS/IT, leaving students from other branches with fewer opportunities.

•	Package Expectations: Students often face confusion about the salary packages offered by different companies. Some students may have unrealistic expectations, while others may feel disappointed with lower package offers compared to others.
